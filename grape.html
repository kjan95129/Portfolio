            <h1>Problem Space</h1>
            <h3>Being a better person is hard</h3>
            <p>People want to do good deeds, but life gets in the way. We often become so absorbed 
                in our own activities and work that we forget to acknowledge others or even ourselves. 
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content-block">
            <h1>The idea</h1>
            <h3>Personal informatics on deed tracking</h3>
            <p>By doing good deeds regularly and keeping track of them on a consistent basis, 
                we allow ourselves to make time and strive to create a more positive environment
                around us and increase the overall happiness for others as well as ourselves.
            </p>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h1>Competition</h1>
            <h3>Other task-tracking apps in the market</h3>
            <p>We had to poke around a bit to make sure that there wasn't an idea identical 
                to ours already in the marketplace. We were aware that there were a myriad of
                task tracking apps, so we had to try to set ourselves apart.

        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
            <p>As expected, we did find a ton of task tracking apps. Some apps motivated
                people with self-improvement and streaks, while other apps gave users
                a way to remind themselves to perform deeds daily.

        <div class="content-block">
            <h1>Storyboards</h1>
            <h3>How would people use our app?</h3>
            <p>Following interviews, we did feel like there was need for personal informatics 
                in regards to doing good deeds. However, we had to put ourselves in the shoes
                of our target audience in order to really understand what functions they would
                need.

            <p>The first idea represents a busy person who isn't necessarily trying to avoid
                good deeds, but simply doesn't have the time to. The second idea represents 
                how friends could do good deeds for each other and record it through the app 
                as well.

            <h1>Prototyping</h1>
            <h3>Paper prototyping before diving into development</h3>
            <p>We decided to go with two different prototypes to satisfy two different potential 
                users. The first prototype focused on being more text based, while the second prototype 
                focused on visualization and gamification of the idea. Here are a selection of the pages:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-pane">
            <img src="static/grape/prot_1_1.jpg"/>
            <img src="static/grape/prot_1_2.jpg"/>
            <img src="static/grape/prot_1_3.jpg"/>
            <br/>
            <img src="static/grape/prot_2_1.jpg"/>
            <img src="static/grape/prot_2_2.jpg"/>
            <img src="static/grape/prot_2_3.jpg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
            <p>Asking a couple of colleagues, we concluded that the text-based prototype (pictured on the 
                top row) seemed more 'professional' and simply got the job done. However, many people 
                seemed to be more fond of the second prototype (pictured on the bottom row), as it was 
                much more visual than the first. </p>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h1>Heuristic Testing</h1>
            <h3>Checking for missing heuristics in our prototype</h3>
            <p>Although both protoytpes shared some major flow issues when we conducted the tests, doing 
                a further analysis on the heuristics allowed us to realize that prototype 2 could be 
                improved by giving the user some amount of freedom with respect to navigation, as well 
                as the way data is handled after data entry. The addition of a back button would also help 
                tremendously with navigation for the user. It was time to put our concept into code.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h1>User Testing</h1>
            <h3>Putting the finishing touches on the design of our app</h3>
            <p>After spending a week converting our prototype into code, it was time to test some more. 
                Our usability script consisted of targets we would hope the user would reach, such as 
                being able to navigate properly and add/delete entries. 
            </p>
            <br/><br/>
            <h3>Breakdowns</h3>
            <p>1) We told the user to edit their entry, but the user didn't know you could just press the 
                text directly in order to edit. 
            </p>
            <p>2) We told the user to complete the challenge and add it to their data, but the person 
                didn't know where to go after completing the challenge. The person just stared at the screen 
                for awhile. Rather than looking for help using the help button, the person asked us directly.

            <h1>A/B Testing</h1>
            <h3>Making minute changes to things we couldn't test</h3>
            <p>Based on our feedback, we wanted to test if people would be more inclined to click on the 
                different categories of deeds based on whether they were displayed in a list or as buttons. 
                We decided to A/B test this to see which particular layout would have more conversions. 
                Using google analytics, we could keep track of how many times the users click on each one 
                given one of the two layouts.

        <div class="content-block">
            <p>There were a total of 42 users. 15 had the dropdown bar and 27 had buttons 
                on their reflection page. 4 out of 15 people changed categories using the dropdown 
                bar, while 9 out of the 27 people changed categories using buttons.

        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
            <p>Based on the number of participants in our study, we expected 4.643/10.357 people 
                to convert using the dropdown bar and half the people to convert using the 
                buttons. These expected values are very close to what we actually observed. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="image-pane">
            <img src="static/grape/ab_3.png"/>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
            <p>The null hypothesis that we decided on was that there is no difference between 
                buttons and the dropdown bar on the reflection page. We used the above chi squared 
                test to test this hypothesis. Based on the test our calculated value was .02, which was 
                far off from the 3.84 threshold we needed to consider the change significant. Therefore, 
                we failed to reject the null hypothesis that here is no difference between the buttons 
                and the dropdown bar.
