However, many people seemed to be more fond of the second prototype\n              (pictured on the bottom row), as it was much more visual than the first. </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"content-block\">\n          <h1>Heuristic Testing</h1>\n          <h3>Checking for missing heuristics in our prototype</h3>\n          <p>Although both protoytpes shared some major flow issues when we conducted the tests, doing a further analysis\n              on the heuristics allowed us to realize that prototype 2 could be improved by giving the user some amount\n              of freedom with respect to navigation, as well as the way data is handled after data entry. The addition\n              of a back button would also help tremendously with navigation for the user.

Our usability script\n              consisted of targets we would hope the user would reach, such as being able to navigate properly and add/delete\n              entries.\n          </p>\n          <br/>\n          <br/>\n          <h3>Breakdowns</h3>\n          <p>1) We told the user to edit their entry, but the user didn't know you could just press the text directly in order\n              to edit.\n          </p>\n          <p>2) We told the user to complete the challenge and add it to their data, but the person didn't know where to go\n              after completing the challenge.

We decided to A/B test this to see\n              which particular layout would have more conversions.
