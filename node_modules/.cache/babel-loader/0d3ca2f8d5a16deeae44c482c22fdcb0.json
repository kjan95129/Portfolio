Parking is always a huge hassle at my alma-mater UCSD, but we wanted to stray away from the typical\n              parking app. Instead, our team came up with an idea of a peer-to-peer valet service, similar to that of Uber.\n              People could pay others to get their car parked, and other people could earn money parking peoples' cars.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"content-block\">\n          <h1>How it works</h1>\n          <h3>How does it work for drivers?</h3>\n          <p>Need your car parked? When you’re having trouble finding a parking spot, Violet helps you call a valet to park\n              your car. You can schedule a valet ahead of time, or right when you find yourself lost in a parking lot.\n              Our valets will drive your car to a legal, safe and accessible spot so that you don’t have to worry about\n              parking. You will have the option to either provide your valet with a spare key which the valet will store\n              somewhere in the car after their service, or we can provide you with a secure lock box with GPS tracking\n              that you can unlock using the app or a unique PIN code. Valets will store your keys in this box for you or\n              any other valets to pick up later. Still unsure? Violet provides up to $25,000 in insurance for any damages\n              done by our valets. Valets will also be rated by other users and you can where your valet is going at any\n              time.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"image-pane\">\n          <img src={driver_1} alt='driver' />\n          <img src={driver_2} alt='driver' />\n          <img src={driver_3} alt='driver' />\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"content-block\">\n          <h3>How does it work for valets?</h3>\n          <p>Have time on your hands and want to make extra cash? Violet can help you find drivers willing to pay you to find\n              them a parking spot. The driver will meet up with you, and all you have to do is park their car for them.\n              We’ll automatically add the money to your account. If you run into a problem with their car, don't worry.\n              Violet will insure the customer's car, so your problems are our problems.

Brand A had\n              a lower conversion rate, but the clickthrough keywords were much more along the lines of what we were targeting,\n              with \"valet\" being a highly searched word.
